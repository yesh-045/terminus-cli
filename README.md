# Terminus

A lightweight terminal automation system with local AI agents.

## What it does

terminus is a powerful CLI tool that brings AI-powered automation to your terminal. It's designed to handle **any** repetitive task - from file operations and system administration to development workflows and data processing. Think of it as your intelligent terminal assistant that can understand natural language and execute complex multi-step operations.

Unlike complex IDE extensions or heavyweight automation tools, terminus is:
- **Terminal-native**: Works in any shell, on any system
- **Language-agnostic**: Handles any file type or project structure  
- **Context-aware**: Remembers your workflow and adapts to your project
- **Transparent**: Shows you exactly what it's doing with confirmation prompts

## Core Features

- ** Natural Language Interface**: Describe what you want in plain English
- ** Intelligent File Operations**: Read, write, organize, and transform files with AI assistance
- ** Shell Integration**: Execute commands with smart confirmation and error handling
- ** Session Memory**: Maintains context across conversations for complex workflows
- ** Project Understanding**: Analyzes codebases, detects patterns, and suggests improvements
- ** Safety First**: Confirmation prompts protect against destructive operations
- ** Git Integration**: Smart version control with enhanced status and commit workflows
- ** Task Automation**: Handles repetitive tasks from backups to deployments
- ** Development Tools**: Project scaffolding, testing, and code analysis

## Installation

### Option 1: Using pipx (Recommended)
Install pipx if you don't have it:
```bash
pip install pipx
```

Then install terminus globally:
```bash
pipx install terminus-cli
```

This installs terminus in an isolated environment while making it available globally from any terminal.

### Option 2: Using pip
```bash
pip install terminus-cli
```

### Option 3: Development Installation
For development or local installation:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd terminus-cli
python -m venv env
# On Windows:
env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source env/bin/activate
pip install .
```

```bash
terminus
```

2. **Start automating anything**:
```
# üîç Project Analysis & Discovery
